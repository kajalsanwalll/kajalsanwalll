# About Me

Hi, I'm **Kajal**, an undergraduate student at **IIT Madras** with a strong interest in software engineering and systems-oriented problem solving.  
My background in **Electrical/Electronics Engineering** has shaped a structured, fundamentals-first approach to building reliable and scalable software.

I am particularly interested in **backend engineering, data structures and algorithms, and system design**, and I enjoy translating theory into practical implementations.
