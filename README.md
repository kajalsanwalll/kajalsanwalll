# About Me

Hi, I'm **Kajal**, an undergraduate student at **IIT Madras** with a strong interest in software engineering and systems-oriented problem solving.  
My academic background in **Electrical/Electronics Engineering** has trained me to think rigorously, while my project work focuses on building practical, well-structured software systems.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **core engineering concepts and modern software development**, and I’m particularly interested in roles that require strong fundamentals, clean design, and scalability.
